# Shinkansen Bullet Train Passenger Experience Analysis

This project aims to analyze the factors contributing to the overall travel experience of passengers on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan. The objective is to determine the relative importance of each parameter in influencing passenger feedback towards a positive scale. By analyzing the provided data, we aim to identify the key factors that significantly impact passenger satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two files:

- `Traveldata_train.csv`: Contains the on-time performance of the Shinkansen Bullet Train along with passenger information.
- `Surveydata_train.csv`: Contains feedback from passengers regarding various parameters related to their travel experience, including their overall experience.

## Methodology

The analysis will follow the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and ensure the datasets are in a suitable format for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data.
3. **Feature Selection**: Utilize appropriate techniques to identify the parameters that have a significant impact on passenger satisfaction.
4. **Model Development**: Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to predict passenger satisfaction based on the selected parameters.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the developed model using suitable evaluation metrics.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis results.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place the `Traveldata_train.csv` and `Surveydata_train.csv` files in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.

## Results

The analysis will provide insights into the key parameters that significantly influence passenger satisfaction on the Shinkansen Bullet Train. The predictive model developed will help identify the most influential factors and provide recommendations for enhancing the overall travel experience.

## Conclusion

Improving passenger satisfaction is crucial for the success of any transportation service. Through this analysis, we aim to gain valuable insights that can be used to enhance various aspects of the Shinkansen Bullet Train service and ultimately provide an exceptional travel experience for passengers.
